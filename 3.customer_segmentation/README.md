# Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning

**Customer segmentation, down to its core, is dividing customers into groups that share certain characteristics.**

When we use Unsupervised Learning to find patterns in data through *clustering* or *dimension reduction*, we are practicing pure pattern discovery (because the algorithm is learning without labels) - *unlike* Supervised Learning, whose pattern discovery is guided by labels.

Notebooks are labeled 1,2,3... representing steps taken to complete this project. Each notebook has a brief description in the title of what to expect, and are annotated with comments along the way, describing the reasoning behind what Machine Learning methodologies were used.
