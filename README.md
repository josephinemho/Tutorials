### Use machine learning for predictive maintenance
Identify the optimal time for maintenance.

### Given time constraints and the nature of this exercise, I decided to take a "quick and dirty" approach. Some things I skipped over were:
* Train-test-split the data before scaling
* Feature selection (SelectKBest, SelectFromModel, SelectPercentile, RFE, etc.)
* Use pipelines to chain tasks from preprocessing to modeling, to evaluate multiple models in a convenient way.
